Hey!

Wecome to released 3 of my little program :) (V1.2)

HOW TO USE:
-----------

1) Extract everything from the folder to a safe location (not your desktop for example). 

2) In the extracted folder, go to /dist, in there you will find a .exe file (MDPSaver.exe). Create a shortcut of it and place it on your 
   desktop if you wish to.

3) The first time you start the program, the cmd prompt will open, this is where the program "live" so it's normal. 

3) You will then need to create the Access Password (AP), which is the most important password you really don't have to forget! All the 
   program'bugs seem to happen when you recover / change the AP, so if you don't forget / change it no bugs should ever happen :).

4) Once in the app, feel free to add all your passwords, following this form: a) The site (like Google, Facebook,..)
                                                                              b) The username/email of your account on the site (xx@gmail.com)
                                                                              c) The password itself
-> Using this form, you should be able to always remember your passwords easily and safely. 


IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1) The program is still in BETA, some issues could happen, some of them are repaired (check changelog below)
-> The only way to repair these issues are to let me know about them! Contact me on DISCORD; GaecKo#7545
                                                                                             -----------
2) In the main menu of the program, there is a new feature: "System Settings", which should be only used in case of bugs or reboot.


-> This program is GaecKo#7545's belonging, and uses crypto.py from UCL librairies.
