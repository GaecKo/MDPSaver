Welcome to my **Password Manager App.** 


### <ins> Introduction </ins> 
This app makes it easy for you to:
* **Add** your passwords
* **See** your added passwords
* **Generate** / **Create** passwords for you

All of these are done with the `pycryptodome` and `cryptography` module, to make sure everything is **secure**. By making use of these modules no lambda person will be able to access your **encrypted data**.
