Hey!

Wecome to released 4 of my little program :) (V2)

HOW TO USE:
-----------

0) You need python install on your computer, it can be install from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

1) Extract everything from the folder to a safe location (not your desktop for example). 

2) In the extracted folder, you will see a run.cmd file, create a shortcut of by right-clicking/create shortcut. Name it and customize* it as you wish. 
-> Place the shortcut on your desktop if you wish to.

3) The first time you start the program, the cmd prompt will open, this is where the program "live" so it's normal. 

3) You will then need to create the Access Password (AP), which is the most important password, you really don't have to forget! All the 
   program'bugs seem to happen when you recover / change the AP, so if you don't forget / change it no bugs should ever happen :).

4) Once in the app, feel free to add all your passwords, following this form: a) The site (like Google, Facebook,..)
                                                                              b) The username/email of your account on the site (xx@gmail.com)
                                                                              c) The password itself
-> Using this form, you should be able to always remember your passwords easily and safely. 


* For example, - you can modify the icon: right-click on the shortcut, go to property/change icon.../choose the one you want 
               - you can modify the name: right-click on the shortcut, rename/rename as you want to (MDPSaver for ex.)
               

IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

1) The program is still in BETA, some issues could happen, some of them are repaired (check changelog below)

2) In the main menu of the program, there is a new feature: "System Settings", which should be only used in case of bugs or reboot.
