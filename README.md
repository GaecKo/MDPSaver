### <ins> Introduction </ins> 
This app makes it easy for you to:
* **Add** your passwords
* **See** your added passwords
* **Generate** / **Create** passwords for you

All of these are done with the `pycryptodome` and `cryptography` module, to make sure everything is **secure**. By making use of these modules no lambda person will be able to access your **encrypted data**. 

**General way of working**: An **Access Password** (AP) that you create will be your **key üîë** to all of your **saved password üè†**. Without this AP, *none* of your password will be *readable*! All the password that you will add will be encrypted using a key which is derived from your AP, using *Fernet*, *base64.urlsafe_b64encode*, ...

Status:  `‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞‚ñ∞ 100%`

#### <ins> Python Script </ins> ![Python](.git_files/python.ico)

    * Please make sure that you cross the pip option in the installation wizard as well!
2) Once done, you will need to install some modules:
    * `pip install cryptography`
    * `pip install pycryptodome`
    * `pip install pwinput`
    * `pip install colorama`
    * if `pip` doesn't work, try using `pip3`
    * You now have the prerequired modules to continue!

3) Download and unzip the files
4) Go into the app folder: `./MDPSaver-master/MDP_APP/`
5) You should see all the python scripts, open a terminal in that folder and type  `python MDPSaver.py` or `python3 MDPSaver.py`
    * If you have any issues like:
        * `FileNotFoundError`
        * `Module not found`, ...
    * Make sure you opened a terminal **IN** the `MDP_APP/` folder! It should look like: 
    
    `X:\...\MDPSaver-master\MDPSaver-master\MDP_APP>python MDPSaver.py  `
