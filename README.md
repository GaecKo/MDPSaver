### Standard PySide GUI
This version uses the standard PySide way to built the frontend. However, it doesn't uses any tool like `QtDesigner` or auto-generated code. As this method is long and hard to scale, we decided to switch to a [web-integration](https://github.com/GaecKo/MDPSaver/tree/web-engine-integration) version. 

This version may not be updated anymore, as the main version will be using the web-engine version.
